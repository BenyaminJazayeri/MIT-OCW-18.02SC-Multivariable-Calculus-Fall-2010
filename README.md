My coursework for MIT OCW 18.02SC Multivariable Calculus Fall 2010 class. This covers the exact same coursework required of MIT students present in class for full marks.

All solutions are my own.

Because the Scholar (SC) version of the course was taken, the coursework is organized into Sessions, Problem Sets, Exams and Practice Exams. Each includes the problem statements alongside my handwritten solutions.

Taught by [Prof. Dennis Auroux](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Dennis+Auroux) and Recitation Instructors Christine Breiner, David Jordan and Joel Lewis.
